Joram Barrez has been one of the driving forces for open source BPM for almost 10 years. 
So it wasn't easy when he needed to step away for some time from the Flowable project.
But now he's back and fully committed to help driving the Flowable project with lots of new energy and ideas.
From the whole Flowable team and community, we just wanted to say: "Welcome back Joram!".

Also taking this opportunity to add a link to our new Flowable <a href="https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/wiki/Flowable-roadmap">roadmap page</a>.
If you want to see other features being added to the roadmap, get in contact with us on the <a href="http://forum.flowable.org">Flowable forum</a>.
