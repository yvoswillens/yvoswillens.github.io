Today we released the first Flowable engine version (5.22.0). This release is a fork of  Activiti 5.21.0. There have been no package renaming or config file name changes.
The easiest way to start using it is through the Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.flowable</groupId>
  <artifactId>flowable-engine</artifactId>
  <version>5.22.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The version 5 code is on the flowable5 branch on Github <a href="https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/tree/flowable5">https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/tree/flowable5</a>. <br>
The version 6 code is on master <a href="https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine">https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine</a>.

The 5.22.0 release has the following highlights:

- First Flowable release. With a new Maven group (org.flowable) and artefact id (flowable-engine etc), there are no changes to package names or config file names in the fork of Activiti.
- Introduction of transient variables. Transient variables won't be persisted in the process variable tables, but are still available on the execution for the duration of a single transaction. 
Transient variables can for example be used to store a REST response that is only needed to create a request to another REST service, or to use a Java service task result in the next 
Java service task without it getting persisted. You can read more about it <a href="http://www.jorambarrez.be/blog/2016/09/01/how-to-use-transient-variables-in-activiti/">here</a>
- Several bug fixes and smaller enhancements

A lot of people will also be wondering what will happen with the version 6 engine. It's our main focus to get a new beta release out as soon as possible and 
we want to get the final 6.0 release out shortly after.

We understand that there will be a bit of confusion around starting the Flowable project. We don't plan any package renaming or config filename changes for example. For now, please get in contact with us through the forum <a href="http://forum.flowable.org">http://forum.flowable.org</a>,
and by creating issues on the Github issues page <a href="https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/issues">https://github.com/flowable/flowable-engine/issues</a>.<br>
The developers of the Flowable project are keen to help you answering your questions and helping out with possible issues.<br>
The 5.22.0 release is the starting point for the Flowable project, a lot more releases will follow.
