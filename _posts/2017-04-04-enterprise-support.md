You may have already seen that core developers from the Flowable Project have joined forces with edorasware. 
This doesn’t change our commitment to open source, if anything, it gives us an opportunity to do more.

What it does mean is that there is now Enterprise Support available for the open source Flowable engines, backed by the people that architected and wrote them. 
You can get a support subscription for the open source engines – you don’t need to switch to an Enterprise version, no APIs to change, no package renames or anything. 
Just keep doing what you’re doing, but get the support and hot fixes you need for whatever size and shape production system you have.
